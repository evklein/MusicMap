# MusicMap

This is a short project I wrote using Angular 6. The purpose of this project was to learn a new technology (Angular) and to build a small but scalable single page web application using the BandsInTown API and a dynamic web framework.

More details coming soon!

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.1.
